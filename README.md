# Manpreet Dhindsa - CSUN COMP_541 - Data Mining

The goal of this project is to investigate a higher education institution student records dataset and predict the chance of success. 
The public dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success.

The dataset is labeled into 3 categories (dropout, enrolled, and graduate). I will setup a classification model to predict the students outcome based on the attached data. 

List of continuous inputs - All features not listed must be converted to class type
- Previous qualification (grade)
- Admission grade
- Age at enrollment
- "Curricular%" - All that begin with Curricular 
- Unemployment
- Inflation
- GDP
